# Future Plans

## 100 Days of Code
This site will initially render markdown documents of my 100 Days Of Code Portfolio, with Github links.

Rather than pulling the contnt from a database, the content will be pulled directly from the markdown files.

Would be good to implement code blocks.

## Deployment

I must try to deploy this somewhere. Likely AWS for the learning experience.

## Posts

Currently I only have the 100 Days of Code posts. I might implement a blog, or something like that

## Templates

Need better error handling in the templates
