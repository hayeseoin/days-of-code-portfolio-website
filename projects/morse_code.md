# Morse Code Converter
This script takes in a string, and outputs morse code.

The alphabet is a dictionary of key value pairs, associating each character to the morse code signal. It prints out the phrase in morse code. Letters are folowed by a space, words followed by two spaces. If an incompatible character is entered, it represented with an 'e'.
